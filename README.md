# MPIN Strength Checker and Validator

This project is a comprehensive MPIN (Mobile PIN) strength assessment tool that analyzes and classifies user-entered PINs as `STRONG` or `WEAK` based on statistical patterns, sequentiality, repetition, and demographic data matching. It includes robust testing, synthetic dataset generation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and a machine learning model for prediction.



## Features

- PIN validation for 4-digit and 6-digit formats
- Detection of common and repeated PINs
- Sequential pattern checks (e.g., 1234, 9876)
- Demographic comparison using DOBs and anniversaries
- Shannon Entropy calculation to measure randomness
- Over 50 unit tests for robustness
- Exploratory Data Analysis using Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Logistic Regression model to predict weak or strong PINs
- Balanced synthetic dataset generation for training
